import sum  from './moduleOne.mjs'  // initial name was sumTwoNumber but now I changed it into sum. It is posibble because of export default
const sum1 = sum (10, 234) 
console.log(sum1)                               
const sum2 = sum (1, 2)
console.log(sum2)   
const sum3 = sum (-31, 22)
console.log(sum3)
